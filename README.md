# JafEngine

**I created a JafEngine project, which is a search engine used to search for the results, so any users can use it to get their results, which is helping them to improve their achievements, and enhance their performance.

Now, I would like to tell you how we can use a project in the simplest scenario.
So firstly you need to visit our search engine and create your request, then you will show the results for your requests, which is containing the All, and news section of searching topic, and images that allows the user to get the images for searching topic, and videos section to show the video or click on video link to transfer you to the video regin in youtub.**
